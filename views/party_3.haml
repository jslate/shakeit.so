    Every month, Shake It So hosts an international dance celebration to shine light on a non-profit while adding
    music and dance to your soul. This month we will be celebrating with the LGBT Asylum Task Force, an organization that
    provides comprehensive support in housing, food, and connection to legal, medical, and mental resources during the
    vital time that asylum seekers arrive in this country, but are not allowed to work. Learn more about the
    <a href="http://www.lgbtasylum.org/">LGBT Asylum Task Force</a>.

    Each session is one hour long, you can come to either or both, no RSVP required.

    We are also excited to be working with the
    %a{ href: "https://www.facebook.com/BerlinMASJN" }Berlin Social Justice Network
    to throw our best dance party yet!
