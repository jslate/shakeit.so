              <p>Hey everyone! Jonathan here. Hope you are enjoying your Father's Day. I have a couple of things I want to share
                with you all.</p>

              <h2>Noon Dance Party tomorrow!</h2>

              <p>Tomorrow (June 21, at 12:00PM ET) I'll be hosting the usual Monday noon party. Tune in for some feel good classics!

              <ul>
                <li>Happy Together
                <li>Johnny B. Goode</li>
                <li>Mary Had a Little Lamb</li>
                <li>Sweet Home Chicago</li>
                <li>Knock on Wood</li>
                <li>Some Kind Of Wonderful</li>
                <li>Twist And Shout</li>
                <li>Takin' Care Of Business</li>
                <li>Joy To The World</li>
                <li>(Every Time I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone</li>
                <li>Crocodile Rock</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Monthly International Dance Celebrations</h2>

              <p>Our last fundraiser for the Treehouse Foundation raised, $225, which is enough money for suitcases
                for nine kids in foster care in Massachusetts!

              <p>I'm <b>not going to host an International Dance Party in July</b>. It seems like people are doing other
                things during the summer, and I'm wondering if monthly parties are the right thing, anyway. September probably
                won't happen either, it's going to be crazy getting both kids off to school right around then.
                But I do  want to have a party in August!</p>

              <h2>August International Dance Celebration with live music!</h2>

              <p>So Aidan (bass), Nolan (drums), and I have formed a little blues and rock trio. We don't have a name, and I haven't picked a date yet.
                But for the August party, I won't be dancing, because I'll be too busy playing my guitar! I <i>think</i> we'll be raising money for
                <a href="https://gbls.org">Greater Boston Legal Services</a>, but there are still some details to work out. Stay tuned!</p>

              <h2>Rethinking Parties going forward</h2>

              <p>With all that in mind, I'm rethinking my dance parties, especially the fundraisers, going forward. Some
                things I'm considering:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Less frequent events, so when they do happen, they are a bigger deal!</li>
                <li>A focus on organizations working for racial justice and defending democracy in the U.S.</li>
                <li>More live music!</li>
                <li>Live music from other countries!</li>
              </ul>

              <p>But everything is up for conversation. Would you like to be part of that discussion?
                If so, reply to let me know. I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>

              <p>Thanks so much, take care everyone. -Jonathan</p>
