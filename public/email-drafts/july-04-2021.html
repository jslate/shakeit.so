              <p>Happy 4th of July everyone! A couple of small updates.</p>

              <h2>9AM Dance Party Tomorrow</h2>

              <p>
                Usually Monday parties are at noon, but tomorrow's will be at 9AM ET. The weather is supposed to be decent
                people should go out at noon!

              <h2>International Dance Celebration: Saturday, August 7</h2>

              <p>
                The next big party will be Saturday, August 7th at 8PM ET. We'll be raising money for
                <a href="https://gbls.org">Greater Boston Legal Services</a>. There are still a few details to work out,
                but I'm hoping to feature some musicians you might know, personally! I've also started talking to a young
                art student in Ireland about some visual elements, so there might be some interesting additions elements.
                Plus we might be able to truly call this one international! More details to follow in the coming weeks.
